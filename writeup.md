## Question 1

Take a look at the file labeled `data/phase0.txt`. Why might we have missing values or values that state "NO DATA" in this dataset? While we are currently ignoring these values, what might be the risk of filtering these values out?

[Missing values or values that state "NO DATA" are likely present in the data/phase0.txt file because the data was likely unavailable or not recorded. The risk of filtering these values out may skew our data, causing us to draw false conclusions.]

## Question 2

During sleep, we expect maximum heart rate of a phase to be **lower** than the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase does sleep occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings.

[In Phase 0 the maximum heart of 93 BPM compared to the additional three phases that were above that. In Phase 1 we found that the maximum heart was 110 BPM, in Phase 2 maximum heart rate is 117, while in Phase 3, maximum heart rate is 99 BPM. This means we can assume that in Phase 0 sleep occurs.]

## Question 3

During exercise, we expect the maximum heart rate of a phase to be **higher** the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase(s) does exercise occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings. 

[In Phase 2 we see the highest maximum heart rate of 117 BPM, indicating that the participant is likely exercising durig this phase. If we examine Phase 1 highest maximum heart rate of 110 BPM versus Phase 2, using the box plot visualization we see that in Phase 1, 110 BPM is an outlier, whereas Phase 2 the higher heart rates are more consistent.]

## Question 4

During regular periods of awake activity, we expect the average heart rate of a phase to be relatively **lower** than the average heart rate of other phases, but we also expect standard deviation to be **higher**. In which phase do we notice this trend?

[Phase 3 has the lowest average of all the other phases. Although in Phase 3 the standard deviation is not the highest, I believe this phase depicts regular activity, using the box plot, we can see that the BPM more consistently congregate towards the lower beats per minute. In comparison to the data of the other phases, Phase 2 has the highest standard deviation but its average heart is not relatively low compared to the other phases.]
